bytes are falling into memory space:
	-one byte per nanosecond
	-each byte is given as x y coordinate
		-x is distance from left edge
		-y is distance from top
	-Falling bytes corrupt coordinates
	
Memory space is 2d grid
	-Dimensions are 7x7 for example
		-Index ranges from 0 to 6 in both directions
	-Dimensions are 71x71 for real input
		-Index ranges from 0 to 70 in both directions
	
Trying to navigate from top-left corner to bottom-right corner
	-ie start = (0,0) end = (70,70)
	
Simulate falling bytes to figure out safe path
	-12 for example
		-Shortest path is then 22 steps
	-1024 (first kilobyte) for real input
		-Find minimum steps needed to reach exit
