# Advent Of Code 2024
A compilation of my solutions to problems presented in Advent of Code 2024. These solutions were developed
in my free time as a side project during the Winter Break occurring between the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters.

# What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge released every December. The challenge
follows the format of a typical Advent calendar, releasing unique challenging problems daily
from December 1st to December 25th. Each problem consists of two parts: the first portion
builds the groundwork for the challenge, typically requiring the implementation of more commonly 
known techniques and algorithms to arrive at the desired solution; while the second portion generally 
adds an unexpected twist to the problem, which more often than not, forces the programmer to completely
overhaul their solution or delve into new / less-commonly known algorithms.

More information, as well as the prompts corresponding to the included solutions can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com)

Please note: While I strived to adhere to best practices and OOP Design standards
as much as possible in the following solutions, due to the timed nature of AoC, 
many solutions may be more procedural in nature (perhaps with the addition of a small
"struct-like" class for representing data). In some cases, my modularity leaves a lot
to be desired. The purpose of the following solutions is to demonstrate my code maintenance
and organization, my ability to adapt and problem-solve solutions to unique problems
that deviate from standard industry norms, and spark discussion amongst others who participated
in the AoC event.
